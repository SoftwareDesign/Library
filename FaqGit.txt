0. It would be greate if you could share your your issues and solutions here.


1. You have to perform merge during pull if you have some local changes.
Usually you could use the "Reset file changes" operation to reset all your local changes first, and there will be less merge then.
It is very useful for the changes on database file which was applied during running of the website.


2. I use GitExtension with HTTPS URL, the push always hangs while the pull work fine.

It is a known issue of GitExtension:
https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/issues/85

For me, I just commit by GitExtension at first, and then push by git bash with follow command line:
git push --recurse-submodules=check --progress "origin" master:master

You can also try to separate the commit and push operations:
 1) Commit only at first, and then 
 2) Choose the push command from the context menu, there might be a message box to input user name and password of github.
